# Homework 4

Create a Tree class that implements the binary search tree (BST) methods shown below, and stores objects of class Student. You need to implement a Student class that stores name, major, and state of origin. The students should be sorted alphabetically by names in the tree:

[20 points] Insert (a new value into the tree while maintaining the BST structure): void insert(str studName, str major, str originState)

[20 points] Insert (a new value into the tree while maintaining the BST structure): void insert(Student newStudent)

[20 points] Delete (an existing value from the tree. If the value doesn’t exist in the tree output a “Student not found” error message: void delete(str studName)

[10 points] Traversal: PrintInOrder, PrintPreOrder, PrintPostOrder

[10 points] Search (for a value in the tree): bool search (str studName)

[10 points] Height of Binary Tree: int height()

[10 points] Number of leaf nodes: int numLeafNodes()
