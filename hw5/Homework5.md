# Homework 5

Rewrite the Graph class we wrote in class so it uses an Adjacency List instead of an Adjacency Matrix.

For the adjacency list feel free to use array-lists (recommended), linked-lists, or any other container class (other than matrices!).
Look up the notes on array lists (or google them) to see how to use array lists.
code that does not compile or crashes at start is automatically graded with 0!

[20 bonus points] write a 2-page essay about Dijkstra's algorithm. Make sure your work contains a title, your name, and references. You should not copy & paste your work, make sure you rewrite everything you put in your essay and that you do understand it.

[20 bonus points - ALL OR NOTHING] Write a C# implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm and make sure your main method contains some testing of the algorithm. In order to get credit your code has to be complete and correct (no compiling errors and no crashing).

[20 bonus points] write a 2-page essay about greedy algorithms. Make sure your work contains a title, your name, and references.
